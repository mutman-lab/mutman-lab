## Technology Stack
- **Programming Language:** C
- **Hardware Components:**
  - DC motors
  - Motor driver (e.g., L298N or equivalent)
  - Microcontroller (e.g., Arduino or similar)
  - Push buttons (for control input)

## How It Works
1. **Hardware Setup:**
   - Connect the DC motors to the motor driver.
   - Attach the motor driver to the microcontroller.
   - Use push buttons on the remote to send control signals.

2. **Software:**
   - The microcontroller processes input from the push buttons and sends signals to the motor driver to control the motors' direction.
